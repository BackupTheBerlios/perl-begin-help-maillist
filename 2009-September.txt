Hello All

I have a question which is provided below:
Do you happen to have any idea on this:
Any pointers for this :
----------------------------------------------------

Each cell of an N x N grid is either a 0 or a 1. You are given two such N x
N grids, the initial grid and the final grid. There is a button against each
row and each column of the initial N x N grid. Pressing a row-button toggles
the values of all the cells in that row, and pressing a column-button
toggles the values of all the cells in that column. You are required to find
the minimum number of button presses required to transform the grid from the
initial configuration to the final configuration, and the buttons that must
be pressed in order to make this transformation.
*Edit:* When the initial and the final configurations are the same, print
"0".
Input

 The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 10). Then t test
cases follow.

Each test case has the following form:
* The first line contains n, the size of the board (1 ? n ? 1000).
* n lines follow. The ith line contains n space separated integers
representing the ith row of the initial grid. Each integer is either a 0 or
a 1.
* n lines follow, representing the final grid, in the same format as above.
Output

 For each test case, output the number of row-button presses, followed by
the row buttons that must be pressed. Print the number of column-button
presses next, followed by 0-indexed indices of the column buttons that must
be pressed. The total number of button presses must be minimized.
Output "-1" if it is impossible to achieve the final configuration from the
initial configuration. If there is more than one solution, print any one of
them.
Example

*Input:*
1
3
0 0 0
1 1 0
1 1 0
1 1 0
1 1 1
1 1 1

*Output:*
1
0
1
2
